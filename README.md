# Virtunexa Internship ‚Äì Task 1

This repository contains two Python-based mini-projects developed as part of my Python Developer Internship at Virtunexa. Both assignments demonstrate practical applications of Python fundamentals‚Äîone with data automation using web scraping, and the other with a user-friendly calculator built using Tkinter for GUI integration.

## üîç Project 1: Web Scraper  
A lightweight Python script that extracts data from a specified website using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. The goal was to automate data retrieval and present it in a clean format (e.g., CSV or terminal output).

**Key Features:**
- URL-based scraping logic  
- Structured data parsing with `BeautifulSoup`  
- Output stored or displayed in user-friendly format  
- Exception handling for invalid requests and parsing errors  

## üßÆ Project 2: Arithmetic Calculator with GUI  
A simple GUI-based calculator developed using `Tkinter` that supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The project emphasizes interactive design and functional layout.

**Key Features:**
- Clean and intuitive interface  
- Dynamic input validation  
- Support for all standard arithmetic operations  
- Modular code structure and responsive button layout
